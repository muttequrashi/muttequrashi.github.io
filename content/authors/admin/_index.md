I am Mutte Ur Rehman, a Robotics and Computer Vision Engineer with a passion for solving real-world problems using technology. I have a Master's degree in Computer Vision and Robotics from the Universit√© de Bourgogne in France.

I have experience in developing and deploying computer vision systems using OpenCV, Python, and other tools. I have also worked on designing and building robotic systems, including a smart snowplow robot, a QR-driven parallel automation system, and a UVC light disinfectant robot.
